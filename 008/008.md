# Extremely Complex Quantitative Finance Problem: Multi-Asset Optimal Portfolio and Derivative Pricing under Stochastic Jump-Volatility with Partial Integro-Differential Equations (PIDEs)

## Problem Statement

You are required to develop a highly sophisticated quantitative finance framework to optimize portfolios and price derivatives in a multi-asset market where assets follow stochastic volatility models combined with jump-diffusion processes. The dynamics capture jumps in both returns and volatility, featuring complex inter-asset correlation structures.

Key challenges you must address include:

- Modeling asset prices with **stochastic jump-volatility** processes, incorporating both continuous diffusion components and discontinuous jump components in returns and volatility simultaneously.
- Formulating and solving the **optimal portfolio consumption problem** for a risk-averse investor under this stochastic jump dynamic framework.
- Handling **partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs)** arising from jump terms in portfolio optimization and option pricing.
- Incorporating realistic market constraints such as limited borrowing and short-selling restrictions.
- Efficiently calibrating the model parameters including jump intensity, jump size distributions (e.g., double-exponential or log-truncated double-exponential), stochastic volatility parameters, and correlations among multiple assets.
- Pricing multi-asset exotic derivatives (e.g., barrier, Asian, cliquet options) in this jump-stochastic volatility setting using advanced numerical methods such as Fourier or PROJ methods.
- Computing portfolio-level risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) via simulation or analytical approximations.
- Ensuring high computational efficiency to allow for practical use in real-time risk management or trading systems.

## Tasks and Requirements

1. **Mathematical Modeling:**
   - Define multi-asset stochastic processes with jump diffusion in returns and volatility.
   - Derive the governing PIDEs that characterize optimal control policies and derivative prices.
   
2. **Numerical Solution:**
   - Implement efficient schemes for solving PIDEs, such as finite difference methods coupled with quadrature for integral terms or Fourier-space projection (PROJ) methods.
   - Use dimension reduction, sparse grids, or advanced interpolation to manage curse of dimensionality in multi-asset case.
   
3. **Portfolio Optimization:**
   - Solve the stochastic dynamic programming problem with consumption and investment decisions in continuous time.
   - Integrate jump-induced constraints and nonlinear utility functions (e.g., CRRA) into the framework.
   
4. **Calibration:**
   - Fit the model to observed market data (option prices, historical volatilities, jump statistics) via maximum likelihood or moment matching.
   - Handle parameter identifiability issues in jump and volatility components.
   
5. **Derivative Pricing:**
   - Price sophisticated multi-asset derivatives incorporating jump-stochastic volatility dynamics.
   - Implement Monte Carlo simulation with variance reduction and Fourier pricing techniques.
   
6. **Risk Metrics Computation:**
   - Calculate portfolio risk measures under jump volatility dynamics, incorporating tail risks from jumps.
   - Perform scenario and stress testing involving extreme jump events.

## Input Data

- Time series of asset prices for multiple correlated assets.
- Market option prices and implied volatilities for calibration.
- Investor's utility function parameters (e.g., risk aversion coefficient).
- Market constraints on trading, borrowing, and short-selling.

## Expected Output

- Optimal portfolio allocation and consumption policies over time.
- Prices and sensitivities (Greeks) of complex multi-asset derivatives.
- Calibrated model parameters.
- Portfolio risk metrics (VaR, CVaR) reflecting jump and volatility risks.
- Numerical diagnostics on solution accuracy and convergence.
