# Extreme Quantitative Finance Problem: Multi-Asset Portfolio Risk and Option Pricing under Stochastic Volatility and Jump Diffusion

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with designing and implementing a comprehensive quantitative finance system that models the joint dynamics of multiple assets under realistic market conditions and computes the risk and prices of derivative portfolios.

The system should incorporate:

- **Multi-dimensional stochastic processes**: Model asset prices using stochastic volatility models (e.g., Heston model) combined with jump diffusion processes to capture both continuous price changes and sudden market jumps.
  
- **Correlation structure**: Model the correlation between multiple assets, including their returns, volatilities, and jump occurrences.

- **Portfolio Simulation and Risk Measures**: Simulate the portfolio's future value paths under the joint dynamics, and compute advanced risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for the portfolio over specified horizons.

- **Exotic Option Pricing**: Price path-dependent options (e.g., Asian options, barrier options) on the multi-asset portfolio using advanced Monte Carlo techniques with variance reduction, and accommodate early exercise features where applicable (e.g., American-style options).

- **Calibration**: Calibrate the model parameters to market data, such as option prices, historical volatilities, and jump intensities.

- **Computational Efficiency**: The implementation should be optimized for computational efficiency and scalability to handle high-dimensional portfolios and large simulation runs.

## Tasks

1. **Model Development**  
   - Formulate the joint asset price process incorporating stochastic volatility and jump components.  
   - Define and implement the correlation structure for underlying Brownian motions and jump processes.

2. **Simulation Engine**  
   - Develop a Monte Carlo simulation engine that generates correlated multi-asset price paths with stochastic volatility and jumps.  
   - Implement variance reduction methods (e.g., control variates, antithetic variates).

3. **Risk Management Module**  
   - Using the simulated paths, calculate portfolio-level risk metrics such as VaR and CVaR.  
   - Implement stress testing functionalities including jump scenarios and volatility shocks.

4. **Option Pricing Module**  
   - Price complex path-dependent options considering stochastic volatility and jumps.  
   - Handle early exercise features via least-square Monte Carlo or other regression-based methods.

5. **Parameter Calibration**  
   - Fit model parameters to observed market option prices and historical data using numerical optimization and statistical inference techniques.

6. **Performance and Optimization**  
   - Optimize computational performance for real-time or near real-time risk monitoring and pricing.  
   - Utilize parallel computing where suitable.

## Input

- Market data including historical asset prices, option prices, and volatility surfaces.
- Portfolio specifications including underlying assets, quantities, and option contracts.
- Model parameters or starting guesses for calibration.

## Output

- Simulated future portfolio value distributions.
- Risk metrics (VaR, CVaR) at chosen confidence levels and horizons.
- Option prices with Greeks (sensitivities).
- Calibrated model parameters.

## Constraints & Considerations

- Support a high number of assets (e.g., 10+) and simulation paths (e.g., 100,000+).
- Maintain numerical stability and convergence in Monte Carlo simulations.
- Ensure model calibration performs robustly and efficiently.
- Provide comprehensive documentation and modular code for extensibility.

## Example Scenario

Input:

Portfolio of 15 equities with correlated stochastic volatilities and jumps.

Portfolio includes European and American Asian options.

Market data includes 5 years of historical prices and option quotes.

Output:

1-day 99% VaR and CVaR for the portfolio.

Calibrated Heston-jump model parameters.

Price and Greeks for all options.
