# Egg Dropping Problem (Dynamic Programming)

## Problem:
You are given **N eggs** and a building with **M floors**.  
Your goal is to determine the **minimum number of egg drops** required in the **worst case** to find the highest floor from which you can drop an egg without it breaking.

### Rules:
1. If an egg breaks when dropped from floor `k`, it will break from **all higher floors** as well.
2. If an egg survives when dropped from floor `k`, it will survive from **all lower floors** as well.
3. Eggs that survive a fall can be used again.
4. The response should be optimized for the **worst-case number of trials**.

### Input:
- `N` — Number of eggs.
- `M` — Number of floors.

### Output:
- Minimum number of moves (egg drops) needed in the worst case.

### Example:
Input:
N = 2, M = 6

Output:
3
Explanation:
Drop from floor 3 → if it breaks, test floors 1 and 2 (max 3 tries).
If it doesn’t break, test floors 4, 5, 6 (max 3 tries).

### Follow-up:
1. Implement a solution using **Dynamic Programming**.
2. Optimize to work efficiently for large `N` and `M` (via DP with binary search or mathematical formulas).
