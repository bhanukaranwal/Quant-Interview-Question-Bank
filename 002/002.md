# Estimate Distribution Bound from Samples

## Problem:
You are given **N samples** drawn independently from a uniform distribution over the interval `[0, d]`, where `d` is unknown.  
Write a function to estimate the upper bound `d` from these samples.

### Details:
- The maximum observed sample is always less than or equal to `d`.
- The naive estimator (max of samples) underestimates `d` on average.
- Your task is to implement a statistically adjusted estimator to provide a meaningful estimate of `d`.
- Explain your reasoning and statistical approach.

### Input:
- An array of floats: samples from an unknown uniform distribution `[0, d]`.

### Output:
- A single float: the estimated upper bound `d`.

### Example:
Input:
samples = [3.2, 1.5, 2.7, 3.8, 1.9]

Output:
estimated_d = 4.56 (example output, correct computation needed)

### Hint:
- Use the fact that for a uniform distribution U(0, d), the maximum of `N` samples is a biased estimator.
- The expected maximum of `N` samples is `(N/(N+1)) * d`.
- Thus, an unbiased estimator for `d` is: `(N+1)/N * max(samples)`.
