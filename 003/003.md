# Implement a Stack Using One Queue (Optimized)

## Problem:
You need to implement a **stack** data structure using only **one queue**.

### Constraints:
- You can only use a single queue as the internal data structure.
- Implement stack operations: `push(x)`, `pop()`, `top()`, and `empty()`.
- All operations should have **amortized O(1)** or as efficient as possible.
- You cannot use any other data structures like arrays, lists, or additional queues.

### Example:
Input:
push(1)
push(2)
top() -> returns 2
pop() -> returns 2
empty() -> returns False

### Hint:
- Use the queue's ability to reorder elements upon each push.
- After pushing a new element, rotate the queue to place the new element at the front, simulating stack LIFO behavior.
